# Category Folder Mapping (Drive folder name -> Static folder name)
# The script will look for these folder names in your Google Drive
# and map them to the corresponding static gallery categories:
#
# Google Drive Structure:
# Main Gallery Folder/
#   ├── drywall/      -> docs/gallery/images/drywall/
#   ├── deck/         -> docs/gallery/images/deck/
#   ├── electrical/   -> docs/gallery/images/electrical/
#   ├── bathroom/     -> docs/gallery/images/bathroom/
#   └── painting/     -> docs/gallery/images/painting/

# Service Account JSON file should be placed in the root directory
# as 'service-account.json' (added to .gitignore for security)
