# Gallery Google Drive Setup Instructions

## Overview
The gallery page is now configured to display images from Google Drive. This allows customers to easily share their project photos, and you can manage the gallery by updating the image URLs in the code.

## How to Add Images to the Gallery

### Step 1: Get Google Drive Image URL
1. Upload the image to Google Drive
2. Right-click the image â†’ Select "Get link"
3. Change sharing to "Anyone with the link"
4. Copy the sharing URL (it will look like: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing`)
5. Extract the FILE_ID from the URL (the long string between `/d/` and `/view`)
6. Convert to direct image URL: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID`

### Step 2: Update the Gallery Code
1. Open `gallery.html`
2. Find the `googleDriveImages` object at the top of the file (around line 19)
3. Add the Google Drive URL to the appropriate project:

```javascript
const googleDriveImages = {
    // Example:
    'drywall-repair-1': 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=YOUR_FILE_ID_HERE',
    'drywall-basement-1': 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=ANOTHER_FILE_ID',
    // ... etc
};
```

### Step 3: Available Image Slots
The following IDs are available for images:

**Drywall Projects:**
- `drywall-repair-1` - Living Room Wall Repair
- `drywall-basement-1` - Basement Finishing

**Deck Projects:**
- `deck-restoration-1` - Complete Deck Restoration
